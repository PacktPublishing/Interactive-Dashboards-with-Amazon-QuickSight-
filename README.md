Amazon QuickSight is a new, cloud-based business analytics service enabling users to visualize and extract business insight from their data. This course teaches you how to connect, prepare and analyze your data inside one of Amazon's newest services. In this course, you will cover an end to end architecture on AWS Big data ecosystem from importing data to S3 storage using Lambda, preparing data using Athena, connecting Athena and QuickSight SPICE and finally visualizing the data using QuickSight. The major topics that will be covered in this course include Big Data Analytics and AWS services, QuickSight account creation, connecting your data to QuickSight, data preparation using functions, QuickSight visualizations, dashboards, and stories.
By the end of this course, you'll have mastered the skills required to build a data analytics solution in AWS using QuickSight along with other related services.
